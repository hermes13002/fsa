# 🚀 F S A • Flutter Smart Assets

**FSA (Flutter Smart Assets)** is a lightweight CLI tool that automatically scans your Flutter project's assets directories, then:

✅ Updates your `pubspec.yaml` with proper indentation  
✅ Generates a strongly-typed `app_assets.dart` file  
✅ Uses **UPPERCASE constants with format suffixes intact (e.g. `LOGO_PNG`)**  
✅ Includes **summary comments** at the top of generated files  

---

## 📦 Installation

```sh
dart pub global activate fsa
```

Make sure the global bin is in your PATH.

---

## ⚡ Usage

```sh
fsa generate
```

This will:

- Scan all files in `assets/`
- Update `pubspec.yaml → flutter: assets:` (with 2-space indentation)
- Generate `lib/app_assets.dart` like:

```dart
// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND
// Generated by fsa (Flutter Smart Assets) - safe mode
// Assets: 6 files | Images: 1 | Fonts: 3 | Lottie: 2

class AppAssets {
  static const LOGO_PNG = "assets/logo.png";
  static const ICON_SVG = "assets/icon.svg";
}

class AppOthers {
  static const CONFIG_JSON = "assets/config.json";
}
```

## 🔧 Example Workflow

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary>❓ Why do I get `command not found: fsa` after installation?</summary>

When you run:

```sh
dart pub global activate fsa
```

Dart installs the `fsa` executable into a **global bin directory**. However, your terminal can only run it if that directory is added to your **PATH**.

<summary>✅ How do I add Dart’s global bin to PATH?</summary>

### macOS / Linux

Add this line to your shell config file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.):

```sh
export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
```

Then reload your terminal:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
setx PATH "$env:PATH;C:\\Users\\<YourUser>\\AppData\\Local\\Pub\\Cache\\bin"

<summary>❓ How do I upgrade to the latest version of fsa?</summary>

If you already installed fsa before and want to upgrade to the latest published version, just run:

```sh
dart pub global activate fsa
```

Dart will automatically detect if there’s a newer version and reinstall it.

If you want to force a clean reinstall, do:

```sh
dart pub global deactivate fsa
dart pub global activate fsa
```
