# ðŸš€ F S A â€¢ Flutter Smart Assets

**FSA (Flutter Smart Assets)** is a lightweight CLI tool that automatically scans your Flutter project's assets directories, then:

âœ… Updates your `pubspec.yaml` with proper indentation  
âœ… Generates a strongly-typed `app_assets.dart` file  
âœ… Uses **UPPERCASE constants with format suffixes intact (e.g. `LOGO_PNG`)**  
âœ… Includes **summary comments** at the top of generated files  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```sh
dart pub global activate fsa
```

Make sure the global bin is in your PATH.

---

## âš¡ Usage

```sh
fsa generate
```

This will:

- Scan all files in `assets/`
- Update `pubspec.yaml â†’ flutter: assets:` (with 2-space indentation)
- Generate `lib/app_assets.dart` like:

```dart
// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND
// Generated by fsa (Flutter Smart Assets) - safe mode
// Assets: 6 files | Images: 1 | Fonts: 3 | Lottie: 2

class AppAssets {
  static const LOGO_PNG = "assets/logo.png";
  static const ICON_SVG = "assets/icon.svg";
}

class AppOthers {
  static const CONFIG_JSON = "assets/config.json";
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Example Workflow

```sh
fsa generate
# âœ… Assets scanned
# âœ… pubspec.yaml updated
# âœ… app_assets.dart created
```
